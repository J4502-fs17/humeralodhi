            <p>Columbia will always be home to me-- and Mizzou has always played a big role in making Columbia feel like a home.</p>
            <p>I know Iâ€™ll be coming back to watch football game, to bring my children to watch the homecoming parade and visit the house decs.</p>
            <p>As a student adjusting to a college schedule, my tutors helped me get an A in my classes.</p>
            <p>The various activities-- like Mizzou After Dark-- all helped create a sense of community.</p>
            <p>Through organizations like the Tiger Pantry, I saw the importance Mizzou places on service.</p>
            <p>There have been so many people at Mizzou who have reached out to help me and make me feel like part of a community.</p>
            <p>I want to give back to those people, those causes, and those organizations.</p>
            <p> I hope to provide aid in any way needed.</p>
            <p>I want to keep up with the organizations I am involved in and dedicate my time and skills in the future to help students in the way the people of MU helped me in my education and college experience.</p>
