          <section class="about me">
              <p>Columbia will always be home to me-- and Mizzou has always played a big role in making Columbia feel like a home.
               I know I’ll be coming back to watch football game, to bring my children to watch the homecoming parade and visit the house decs.
               As a student adjusting to a college schedule, my tutors helped me get an A in my classes.
               The various activities-- like Mizzou After Dark-- all helped create a sense of community.
               Through organizations like the Tiger Pantry, I saw the importance Mizzou places on service.
               There have been so many people at Mizzou who have reached out to help me and make me feel like part of a community.
               I want to give back to those people, those causes, and those organizations.
               I hope to provide aid in any way needed.
               I want to keep up with the organizations I am involved in and dedicate my time and skills in the future to help students in the way the people of MU helped me in my education and college experience.</p>
